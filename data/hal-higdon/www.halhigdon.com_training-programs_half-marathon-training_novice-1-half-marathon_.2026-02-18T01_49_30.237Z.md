### About the Novice 1 Program

The Novice 1 program is designed for beginning runners who want to prepare for their first 13.1-mile race. If you have run several half or full marathons before, you might want to take a look at the [Novice 2 half marathon program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon), which is designed for more experienced runner.

First-timer? This is the program for you. In choosing the half marathon, you are choosing the most popular race distance in America. According to Running USA, 2 million runners did a half marathon last year. That is four times the number of the half million who ran full marathons. If your long-range goal is 26.2 miles, a 13.1 mile race offers a good starting point. Or if 13.1 is more than enough race mileage with no desires to go 26.2 (at least for now), you have discovered one of our most gentle training programs. If you can handle the 3-to-4-mile runs prescribed in Week 1, this program will get you ready to run 13.1 week at the end of 12 weeks.

#### Hal on his Novice 1 Program

Before starting to train for a half marathon, you need to possess a basic fitness level. But assuming no major problems, most healthy people can train themselves to complete a 13.1-mile race. This guide will tell you how. Much more information is contained in my book, Hal Higdon’s Half Marathon Training, published by [Human Kinetics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492517240/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=halhigdon-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1492517240&linkId=0277b92a17a51a2dbad4fc937fa44453).

The following schedule assumes you have the ability to run 3 miles, three to four times a week. If that seems difficult, consider a shorter distance for your first race.

The terms used in the training schedule are somewhat obvious, but let me explain what I mean anyway.

**Pace**: Don’t worry about how fast you run your regular workouts. Run at a comfortable pace, a conversational pace. If you can’t do that, you’re running too fast. (For those wearing heart rate monitors, your target zone should be between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum pulse rate.)

**Distance**: The training schedule dictates workouts at distances, from 3 to 10 miles. Don’t worry about running precisely those distances, but you should come close. Pick a course through the neighborhood, or in some scenic area. In deciding where to train, talk to other runners. GPS watches make measuring courses easy.

**Rest**: Rest is as important a part of your training as the runs. You will be able to run the long runs on the weekend better if you rest before, and rest after.

**Long Runs**: The key to half marathon training is the long run, progressively increasing in distance each weekend. Over a period of 12 weeks, your longest run will increase from 3 to 10 miles. Then, after a brief taper, you jump to 13.1. The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Sundays, but you can do them Saturdays, or any other convenient day.

**Cross-Train**: On the schedule below, this is identified simply as “cross.” What form of cross-training? Aerobic exercises work best. It could be swimming, cycling, walking (see below), cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or even some combination that could include strength training.  Cross train on Wednesdays and/or Saturdays. Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover from the running you do the rest of the week.

**Walking**: Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training. I don’t specify walking breaks, but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired. Be aware that I also offer a separate half marathon training program for those who plan to walk all the way.

**Strength Training**: If you never have lifted weights before, now might not be the best time to start. Wait until after completing this program. If you are an experienced lifter, continue, although you may want to cut back somewhat as the mileage builds near the end. Tuesdays and Thursdays after your run would be good days on which to lift.

**Racing**: Consider doing a couple of races to familiarize yourself with the sport. I have suggested a 5-K race at the end of Week 6 and a 10-K race at the end of Week 9. If you can’t find races at those distances on the weeks suggested, feel free to modify the schedule.

**Juggling**: Don’t be afraid to juggle the workouts from day to day and week to week. Be consistent with your training, and the overall details won’t matter.

Running 13.1 miles is not easy. If it were easy, there would be little challenge to an event such as the half marathon. Whether you plan your half as a singular accomplishment or as a stepping stone to the even more challenging full marathon, crossing the finish line will give you a feeling of great accomplishment. Good luck with your training.

#### Reviews

#### So grateful for this training programme (and it actually works)

October 5, 2022

I was so pleased to come across this free training plan online – I have been following it religiously and am about half way through. I thought the increases on the long runs were going to be too much for me, but actually if you just stick to the plan, it’s totally manageable. I can’t believe I’m managing it![Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/#)

#### Amazing!

September 22, 2021

Thank you, Hal!

Your Half Marathon program helped me to run my first half and beat my goal time by 13 minutes! When I first started, I never would have imagined being able to run the whole race comfortably. My next goal is to tackle the full marathon, of course following your training plan!

#### Half marathon experience

September 11, 2021

Following the program took me from a new 5k runner to completing my 1st half in 2:21.49. My goal was under 2:30. I read his daily tips on Facebook and use a lot of useful information also!! Only started running a year ago. I started this program about 14 wks ago, so had a few extra weeks to prepare.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/#)

#### Gradual Progression Worked Flawlessly

August 22, 2021

I am a 46 year old male and not a runner. I have always wanted to check a half marathon off the list and this program turned me from “not being a runner” to loving running. I slowly worked through some knee and hip pain that just cured itself as I became more fit. I followed all of the distances in the 12 week plan and completed a flat half in one hour and 52 min.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/#)

I am such a believer as going into week 1 had not run even the “long run distance” before which I think was around 3.5 miles. But I pushed through and once I crossed the mid way point of the plan I felt strong and progressed quickly.

#### Took a total newb to a half marathon runner!

August 6, 2021

When I started, running for a few minutes at a time was a real challenge for me. Following this plan, I was completely ready for race day and my body was prepared for the miles. What it wasn’t prepared for was stepping on a massive rock with the arch of my left foot in the dark. I ended up having to walk a lot more and visit the med tent a few times, but I still finished! How many programs prepare you to still battle it out when something goes wrong? I will be using this plan again to train for a new half marathon in the beginning of 2022.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/#)
