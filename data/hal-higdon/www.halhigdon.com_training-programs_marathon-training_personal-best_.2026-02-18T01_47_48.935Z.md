### About the Personal Best Program

This 30-week Personal Best Marathon Training Program is designed for experienced runners, those who have run two or three or more marathons and who would like to improve their times, to achieve Peak Performance, to set a Personal Record (PR), perhaps to score a Boston Marathon qualifying time (BQ). It combines the 18-week Intermediate 1 Marathon Training Program with an additional 12-week Intermediate Base Training Program. Each day, Hal will send you an email telling you what to run and offering a training tip.

This plan is not available in the RunWithHal app, but you can still get the [interactive version](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-4202/hal-higdon-personal-best-marathon-training-program) through TrainingPeaks. Or, explore more training options in the app:

#### Hal on his Personal Best Program

**I DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM FOR EXPERIENCED RUNNERS**, individuals who have run two or three or more marathons and who would like to improve their times, to achieve Peak Performance, to set a Personal Record (PR), perhaps to score a Boston Marathon qualifying time (BQ).

If truth be told, this is not exactly a new marathon training program, but rather two training programs combined for the convenience of Intermediate runners. Personal Best combines my 12-week [Intermediate Base Training Program](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/tp-2884/hal-higdon-base-training-intermediate) with my popular 18-week [Intermediate 1 Marathon Training Program](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-4186/hal-higdon-marathon-intermediate-1). If you are an experienced runner, you could just as easily access each of those programs here on my Web site and move from the first to the second at the end of 12 weeks. Similarly, you could sign up for each of those Virtual Training programs available through [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach/halhigdon#trainingplans) online. But I’ve done the work for you.

Training for the marathon, or any other running race, is not easy. It’s hard work. It takes discipline. But it’s also a lot of fun, particularly if you run with a friend or a group of runners (something I recommend). For more instructions, check the introductions to [Intermediate 1 Marathon](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51139/Marathon-Intermediate-1-Training-Program). Still more in the way of tips and instructions are available when you sign up for the [interactive version of Personal Best](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-4202/hal-higdon-personal-best-marathon-training-program) from TrainingPeaks.
