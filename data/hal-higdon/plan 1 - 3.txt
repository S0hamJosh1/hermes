#### Hal on his Novice 1 Program

**Here is my Novice 1 Marathon Program**, the most popular of all my marathon training programs and, arguably, the most popular training program used by first marathoners anywhere. Is this your first marathon? Have you only begun to run? Novice 1 was designed with you in mind. If you have been running for a year or more and have run a number of races from 5-K to the half marathon, you might want to consider a slight nudge up to [Novice 2](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-4400/hal-higdon-marathon-novice-2), although many experienced runners also favor Novice 1, because of the (relatively) gentle way it prepares you to run 26 miles 385 yards.

Let me explain some of the workouts you will run during the 18 weeks of Novice 1.  More detailed training instructions sent to you in daily emails are available if you sign up for the interactive version of Novice 1, available from [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-15877/hal-higdon-marathon-novice-1). I also have a Novice 1 app.

**Long Runs**: The key to the program is the long runs on weekends, which build from 6 miles in Week 1 to 20 miles in the climactic Week 15. (After that, you taper 3 weeks to get ready for the marathon.) You can skip an occasional workout, but do not cheat on the long runs. Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer, every third week is a “stepback” week, where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward.

**Rest**: Novice 1 marathoners rest on Mondays and rest again on Fridays. This is both to recover after the weekend long runs and to gather energy before them. Scientists suggest that it is during the rest period (the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger. Coaches also will tell you that you can’t run hard unless you are well rested. And it is hard running (such as the long run) that allows you to improve. The secret to success in any training program is consistency, so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program, you can afford–and may benefit from–extra rest.

**Run Slow**: Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more per mile slower than their marathon pace. The problem with offering this advice to first-time novice runners, however, is that you probably don’t know what your marathon pace is, because you’ve never run a marathon before! Don’t worry. Simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace, one that allows you to converse with your training partners. As far as I’m concerned, there is no such thing as “too slow.”  The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance; how fast you cover it doesn’t matter.

**Walking**: Don’t be embarrassed to take walking breaks. Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon. It works during training runs too. While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10, or walking 30 seconds then running 30 seconds before walking again, I suggest that marathon runners walk when they come to an aid station. Here’s why: you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running, It’s a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well. Walking gives your body a chance to rest, and you’ll be able to continue running more comfortably. It’s best to walk when you want to, not when your (fatigued) body forces you too.

**Cross-Training**: Sundays in the Novice 1 training program are devoted to cross-training. What is cross-training? It is any form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting (usually) after your long run. In the Novice 1 program, we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays, although it certainly is possible to reverse that order. The best cross-training exercises are swimming, cycling or even walking. Activities requiring sudden or sideways movements are not always a good choice. You don’t need to cross-train the same each weekend. And you could even combine two or more exercises: walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club.

**Strength Training:** A frequently asked question is: “Should I add strength training to my marathon program?” If you have to ask, you probably should not. I strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and long life, but if you never have pumped iron before, now is probably not the time to start. Wait until after you have some bling around your neck. If you already hang out at the gym, Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training–after you finish your short runs on those days.

**Midweek Training**: Training during the week should be done at a comparatively easy pace. As the weekend mileage builds, the weekday mileage also builds. Add up the numbers, and you’ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends. Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 3 to 10 miles. (I call these my Sorta-Long Runs.) There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays although they are planned as “easy” days.

**Races**: Normally, I don’t prescribe races–or at least too many races–for first-time marathoners. Races can get in the way, particularly if you taper before a race and need extra recovery afterwards. But some racing is convenient, because it introduces newcomers to the racing experience. I suggest you consider doing a half marathon in Week 8, a week when in the normal progression you might do 13 miles as your long run. No half marathon in your neighborhood that week? You can juggle the training schedule to match the local racing calendar. One advantage of doing a half is that afterwards, you can use one of the pace calculators available on the Internet (best is by Greg McMillan) to predict your marathon pace and finish.

#### Reviews

#### Used the Novice Program for my First Marathon!

February 17, 2025

Found this program easy to follow and customize as needed. I was recovering from a knee injury while training, so the extra rest days gave time to continue with physical therapy / strength. Went into my first race saying I was going to be happy with anything under 5 hours since I had just been cleared to run, but ended up running it at a little over 4:32! Really great, simple program- looking forward to trying the intermediate and advanced options as I try to PR (and hopefully BQ one day!)[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/#)

#### 20 years later and still working

January 2, 2025

I found Hal’s training program in 2004 when preparing for my 1st marathon at age 26. It was great and helped me to achieve my goal at that time. Therefore I used it for a lot of other races.

Next year I’m aiming for another marathon as veteran, but I didn217;t hesitate even just a second and returned for his advice and program again. I just hope it will work as it did in 2004 🙂[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/#)

#### Still works for me

October 2, 2024

With more than 30 marathons done now, more than half on trails and marathons, I still like to look at Hal’s Marathon schedules and base my own marathon, and now ultra marathons, training schedules around his schedules.

His training schedules are a great resource

#### Fantastic for Beginners

September 8, 2023

A multi-ironman friend of mine suggested this program when I told him I wanted to run a marathon. I stuck with the program and missed only 2 (low mileage) runs throughout the 18 weeks. I had three goals:

1\. finish

2\. finish without stopping/walking

3\. finish under 4 hours

With this program, I accomplished all three goals! I can’t recommend this enough to anyone who wants to run their first marathon.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/#)

#### 20 years of HAL HIGDON

October 26, 2021

I started to prepare my first marathon in October 2020 with little or no experience in running. In December 2021, I will run my marathon number 30. In between, I completed 94 different programmes: from 5k to Ultra, from Winter to Senior….you name it. Hal has not only helped me to become a better runner and to achieve my targets to run the 6 majors, a Boston qualifiers and a Marathon in each of the seven continent (Antartica included). HAL has been an irreplaceable source of knowledge, a source of motivation and a companion, a friend. Thank you HAL ![Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/#)

#### Hal on his Novice 2 Program

**My Novice 2 Marathon Program** is a slight step upwards in difficulty from [Novice 1](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1/). It is designed for people with some background as runners, whether or not they have run a marathon before. Before embracing Novice 2, you should have been running about a year. You should be able to comfortably run distances between 3 and 6 miles. You should be training 3-5 days a week, averaging 15-25 miles a week. You should have run an occasional 5-K or half marathon race. The higher your fitness level, the easier this 18-week program will be. But don’t feel embarrassed about dropping back to Novice 1. Interactive versions of both programs are available through [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach/halhigdon#trainingplans), with apps also available.

Novice 2 is nearly identical to Novice 1, but there are some differences: 1) You do pace runs on Wednesdays, and 2) the mileage is somewhat higher. Novice 2 consists of several different increments:

**Long runs**: The key to the program is the long run on weekends, which builds from 8 miles in Week 1 to 20 miles in the climactic Week 15. (After that, you taper to get ready for the marathon.) Starting at 8 miles, you get up over 15 miles sooner than in Novice 1 and have an additional run above that distance. You can skip an occasional workout, or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments, but do not cheat on the long runs. Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer, every third week is a “stepback” week, where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward. Rest is an important component of any training program.

**Run slow**: For experienced marathoners, I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more per mile slower than their marathon pace. The problem with offering this advice to many novice runners, however, is that they probably don’t know what their marathon pace is, because they never have run a marathon before! As an experienced runner, you may or may not have run a prior marathon, but hopefully you have done enough races, including a half marathon or two, so that you can predict your marathon pace. If not, don’t worry. Simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace, one that allows you to converse with your training partners, at least during the beginning of the run. Toward the end, you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of putting one foot in front of the other to finish. However, if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly slower than your pace in the first few miles, you probably need to start much slower, or include regular walking breaks. It’s better to run too slow during these long runs, than too fast. The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance; how fast you cover it doesn’t matter.

**Walking breaks**: Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon. It works during training runs too. While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10, or even alternating running and walking as frequently as every 30 seconds, I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station. This serves a double function: 1) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running, and 2) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations, you’ll be less likely to block those behind. It’s a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well. You will lose less time walking than you think. I once ran a 2:29 marathon, walking through every aid station. My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the Olympic Trials employing a similar strategy. And Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks (tying a shoe on one of them) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon. Walking gives your body a chance to rest, and you’ll be able to continue running more comfortably. It’s best to walk when you want to, not when your (fatigued) body forces you too.

**Cross-training**: Sundays in this training program are devoted to cross-training. What is cross-training? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting (usually) after your long run. In this program, we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays, although it certainly is possible to reverse that order. The best cross-training exercises are swimming, cycling or even walking. What about sports such as tennis or basketball? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice. Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program, you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting. One tip: You don’t have to cross-train the same each weekend. And you could even combine two or more exercises: walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club. Cross-training for an hour on Sunday will help you recover after your Saturday long runs.

**Strength Training:** A frequently asked question is: “Should I add strength training to my marathon program?” If you have to ask, you probably should not. I strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and long life, but if you never have pumped iron before, now is probably not the time to start. Wait until after you have the bling hung around your neck. For gym rats, continue to work out, but you might want to cut back on the weights as the long run mileage moves into the double digits. Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training–after you finish your runs on those days.

**Midweek training**: Training on Tuesdays and Thursdays should be done at a comparatively easy pace. As the weekend mileage builds, the weekday mileage also builds. Add up the numbers, and you’ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends. Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 3 to 8 miles, many of them done at race pace. (I call these my Sorta-Long Runs.) There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start. That sounds logical, doesn’t it? Believe me–as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved–it works. How fast is “comfortably easy?” That might vary from day to day. On Tuesday after a day’s rest, you might find yourself running faster than race pace. On Thursday after two days of running, your pace might be significantly slower.

**Race Pace**: What do I mean by “race pace?” It’s a frequently asked question, so let me explain. Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you’re training for. If you’re training for a 4:00 marathon, your average pace per mile is 9:09. So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace (sometimes stated simply as “pace” on the training charts). If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K, “race pace” would be the pace you planned to run in those races. Sometimes in prescribing speedwork, I define paces for different workouts as 5-K pace or 10-K pace, but you won’t be asked to run this fast in the Novice 2 program.

**Rest**: Despite my listing it at the end, rest is an important component of this or any training program. Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period (the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger. Coaches also will tell you that you can’t run hard unless you are well rested. And it is hard running (such as the long runs) that allows you to improve. If you’re constantly fatigued, you will fail to reach your potential. This is why I include two days of rest each week for novice runners. If you need to take more rest days–because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child–do so. The secret to success in any training program is consistency, so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program, you can afford–and may benefit from–extra rest.

**Interactive Training**: If you would like more help with your marathon training, sign up for one of my interactive training programs, and I will send you emails daily telling you how to train along with tips on how to train, plus you can log your training and use other features.

#### Reviews

#### A virtual coach for 21st century running

April 21, 2025

I love using the app! I can block out dates (family, work, sickness/injury) and the app adjusts the rest of the plan automatically. I am reading Hal’s marathon book and have access to numerous free pre-made training plans, but making adjustments or coming up with workouts are too complicated for me. My questions, whether they are about the app or actual running, have been answered by email or by the board on the app in a timely manner. I train with the app during the week and do long runs with a local running group. This combo is working perfectly, and I was able to finish my first half marathon at age 52 at Cincinnati Flying Pig fairly comfortably and now am going to train for my first marathon in October. Highly recommend purchasing the app![Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/#)

#### perfect plan

January 21, 2025

I followed Novice 2 to prepare for my 3rd nyc marathon and ran it faster than ever before. I am a 53yr old woman and was really proud of my time. I ran in 4hrs and 11 min. This program prepared me and had me in the right frame of mind. I loved it and will follow again if I can muster the courage to get to the next level????!!![Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/#)

#### Novice 2 Marathon

December 21, 2024

Just finished my first marathon aged 54 years and managed under 4 hours in 3:55. I have always dipped in and out of running – nothing serious and the furthest I had raced was 5km. I came to this plan wanting something conservative as anything too ambitious would result in my achilles not being happy. I followed this plan with only a slight deviation of running a half-marathon at week 11 to fit in with local races. My aim to just complete a major marathon (London) whilst enjoying it – I didn’t want it to be torture, which was achieved! I can highly recommend this plan – I found it totally doable with only the weekend long runs filling me with dread but elation once completed! Can’t thank Hal enough for giving me one of the best days of my life and memories for me to treasure forever.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/#)

#### Prepared me for my first marathon!

March 21, 2024

I used Novice 2 to train for my first marathon and it worked great! I was able to finish the race without falling apart in the last 10k. I love that you only run 4 times a week and 20 miles was enough to get me through the race. I made my own little training plan to get used to running 20 plus miles a week before starting the plan and I think that really helped make sure I was ready and didn’t get too sore or injured when the plan started.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/#)

#### Hal on his Intermediate 1 Program

**This is my Intermediate 1 Program:** The Novice 1 and Advanced 2 training programs in my quiver of 26.2 arrows represent the extremes. The former program (and Novice 2) are designed for runners running their first marathons, or experienced runners who are happy with that level of training and see no need to do more. The latter program (and Advanced 1) are designed for those very experienced runners, who have done a number of marathons, perhaps have plateaued in their times, and want to maximize their ability by training hard and incorporating speedwork into their training.

In between, there’s a broad area for runners just like you! If you previously have trained using one of the Novice programs (1 or 2), you now can increase your mileage a bit, run some workouts at a faster pace, and seek improvement.

The [Intermediate 1](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-139217/hal-higdon-marathon-intermediate-1) program offers a slight jump in difficulty from the Novice programs. You begin in Week 1 with a long run of 8 miles instead of 6 miles. You thus get to 20 miles for your long run by Week 13, which permits a second 20-miler in Week 15. Midweek mileage is slightly higher, but instead of cross-training on the weekends, you get more serious about your running and do a second run of 5-8 miles, often at marathon race pace. You now do your cross-training on Mondays, instead of taking the day off. [Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) offers still another jump in difficulty (more miles), but let’s concentrate for now on Intermediate 1.

Here is an explanation of the type of training you will encounter in Intermediate 1. Additional tips and instructions are available if you sign up for the interactive version, available through [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-4186/hal-higdon-marathon-intermediate-1).

**Long Runs**: The key to the program is the long run on weekends, which builds from 8 miles in the first week to a maximum of 20 miles. Although some experienced runners do train longer, I see no advantage in doing 23, 26 or even 31 mile runs. (I’ve tried that myself in the past, and it just wore me out.) Save your energy and concentrate on quality runs. Consistency is most important. You can skip an occasional workout, or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments, but do not cheat on the long runs. Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer, every third week is a “stepback” week, where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward.

**Run Slow**: Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 or more seconds per mile slower than their marathon pace. This is very important. Listen to what the Coach is about to tell you! The physiological benefits kick in around 90-120 minutes, no matter how fast you run. You’ll burn a few calories and trigger glycogen regenesis, teaching your muscles to conserve fuel. Running too fast defeats this purpose and may unnecessarily tear down your muscles, compromising not only your midweek workouts, but the following week’s long run. Save your fast running for the marathon itself. There are plenty of days during the week, when you can run race pace. So simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace, one that allows you to converse with your training partners, at least during the beginning of the run. Which brings up my next point.

**3/1 Training**: Toward the end of the run, if you’re still feeling fresh, you may want to pick up the pace and finish somewhat faster. This will convert your long run into what I call a 3/1 Run. That means you run the first three-fourths of your long run (say the first 12 miles of a 16-miler) at an easy pace, then do the final one-fourth (4 miles of a 16-miler) at a somewhat faster pace–though still not race pace. This 3/1 strategy is advised for only the most experienced runners, and I don’t recommend you do it more than once out of every three weekends. In other words: first weekend, easy run; second weekend, 3/1 Run; third weekend, step back to a shorter distance. My philosophy is that it’s better to run too slow during long runs, than too fast. The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance; how fast you cover it doesn’t matter.

**Walking Breaks**: Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy even for intermediate runners, and it works during training runs too. While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10, or walking 1 minute every mile, I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station. This serves a double function: 1) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running, and 2) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations, you’ll be less likely to block those behind. It’s a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well. (In training, you may want to wear a water belt to insure proper hydration.) You will lose less time walking than you think. I once ran a 2:29 marathon at age 49, walking through every aid station. My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the Olympic Trials employing a similar strategy. And Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks (tying a shoe on one of them) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon. Walking gives your body a chance to rest, and you’ll be able to continue running more comfortably. It’s best to walk when you want to, not when your (fatigued) body forces you too.

**Race Pace**: What do I mean by “race pace?” It’s a frequently asked question, so let me explain. Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you’re training for. If you’re training for a 4:00 marathon, your average pace per mile is 9:09. So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace (sometimes stated simply as “pace” on the training charts). If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K, “race pace” would be the pace you planned to run in those races. Sometimes in prescribing speedwork, I define paces for different workouts as 5-K pace or 10-K pace, but you won’t be asked to run this fast in the Intermediate 1 program.

**Cross-Training**: Mondays in the intermediate programs are devoted to cross-training. What is cross-training? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while training (usually) the day after your long run. In this program, we run long on Sundays and cross-train on Mondays. The best cross-training exercises are swimming, cycling or even walking. What about sports such as tennis or basketball? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice. Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program, you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting. One tip: You don’t have to cross-train the same each week. And you could even combine two or more exercises: walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club. Cross-training for 30-60 minutes will help you recover after your Sunday long runs.

**Midweek Training**: Training during the week also should be done mostly at a comparatively easy pace. As the weekend mileage builds, the weekday mileage also builds. Add up the numbers, and you’ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends. Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 5 to 8 miles. There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start. That sounds logical, doesn’t it? Believe me–as hundreds of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved–it works.

**Rest**: Despite my listing it at the end, rest is an important component of this or any training program. Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period (the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger. Coaches also will tell you that you can’t run hard unless you are well rested. And it is hard running (such as the long runs) that allows you to improve. If you’re constantly fatigued, you will fail to reach your potential. This is why I designate Friday as a day of rest foriIntermediate runners. It allows you to gather strength for hard running on Saturdays and Sundays. If you need to take more rest days–because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child–do so. And if you’re tired from the weekend, take Monday off as well–or cut the length of your cross-training. The secret to success in any training program is consistency, so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program, you can afford–and may benefit from–extra rest.

**Speedwork?** There is no speedwork involved in the Intermediate 1 program. If you feel you need speedwork to improve, check out the advanced training schedules, which offer hill training, interval training and tempo runs on different days of the week. Normally, however, I recommend that marathoners save their speedwork for times of the year when they are not doing a marathon mileage buildup. Check the shorter-distance training programs elsewhere on this web site for more on that.

**Modifying the program**: My training programs are not carved in concrete, and you can make appropriate changes based on your experience, or to suit your convenience. One frequent request made by runners asking questions on the Internet is to modify the order of the weekend runs–particularly by those who want to run long on Saturdays instead of Sundays, because that’s when their friends do their long runs. Running with friends is certainly more fun than running alone, but the pace runs are placed on Saturdays ahead of the long runs on Sundays for a purpose. The main reason is to tire you out a bit in the first workout Saturday so you are not tempted to do the second workout Sunday too fast. It is also difficult to hit race pace on Sunday the day after a draining long run. Some runners ask if they can split these two workouts, for example, running pace on Friday and long on Sunday. They can, but it defeats somewhat the purpose of two “hard” workouts back to back on Saturdays and Sundays. Most runners have more time for their training on the weekends. So modify the program if you want, but if you make too many modifications, you’re not following the program.

#### Loving this approach

April 3, 2025

As an older runner I have consistently struggled with injuries in my marathon ambitions. This time I began in January with the intermediate 1 plan. I’m now 45 days away from my goal race May 4, when I have the audacious goal of obtaining a BQ during my first road marathon at age 67! Taking is slow on my weekday runs and making sure that I get in the long runs every weekend has been key to my ability to wake up the day after a long run feeling bouncy like I could run again! Thanks to Hal Higdon and his crew for making the plans available for free.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/#)

It help me to build my self confidence

#### Great plan as a guide for how to ramp up distance and keep packing on miles, and the taper was just right. THANK YOU!

September 21, 2024

I did this plan modified to my schedule, so I was running 5x a week in a row on weekdays, with long runs on Friday and pace day on Monday. I took weekends to rest or do other training. I just ran my first marathon and CRUSHED my goals and qualified for Boston in 18-34 F! Thank you so much for the guidance on how and when and what to train. I trusted in the process & it worked.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/#)

#### First Marathon first time doing a training program.

August 21, 2023

I am kind of new to running, or I have not ran most of my life. Never did more than a 10K prior to this year. I was able to complete the intermediate 1 training program and did my marathon in 4:11:14. I was able to get through my training fairly easy. It gave me a good base to judge my next endeavor. Planning on another marathon in October and I think I will go with a more challenging program. I would recommend the Hal Higdon training program for people looking to do a first marathon.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/#)

#### Tried and true path to Boston

April 13, 2020

I started my first two marathons with the Novice 1 and qualified for Boston. Decided to step it up to the Intermediate 1 and this really lowered my time by 20 minutes, along with running with some fast runners. Intermediate 1 is challenging but also works with a busy work schedule. For Boston training I do use Hals’s Boston Bound training and made me strong for the hills. On my way to Berlin and using Intermediate 1 again.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/#)
