### About the Novice Supreme Program

Are you a new runner with a limited background in running, yet you still would like to run a marathon? This Novice Supreme combines Hal's 12-week Novice Base Training Program with the 18-week Novice 1 Marathon Training Program, but at a discount price compared to what you would pay for each program separately. You begin training 30 weeks ahead of your planned marathon with a long run of only 3 miles in the first week of training. Then after 12 weeks of graduated training, you make an easy transition to the 18-week Novice 1 Marathon Training Program that leads to a marathon of your choice.

If you want success in your first marathon, this is the way to go. Each day, Hal will send you an email telling you what to run and offering a training tip.

This plan is not available in the RunWithHal app, but you can still get the [interactive version](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-139220/hal-higdon-novice-supreme-marathon-training-program) through TrainingPeaks. Or, explore more training options in the app:

#### Hal on his Novice Supreme Program

**I DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM FOR NEW RUNNERS**, specifically those individuals new to the sport of long distance running who would like to start in the spring to get ready to run a marathon in the fall. Individuals who plan to get serious about their training and dedicate six or seven months to training for their first marathon.

If truth be told, this is not exactly a new marathon training program, but rather two training programs combined for the convenience of beginning runners. Novice Supreme combines my 12-week [Base Training Program](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/tp-15998/hal-higdon-base-training-novice) with my popular 18-week [Novice 1 Marathon Training Program](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-15877/hal-higdon-marathon-novice-1). If you are a beginning runner, you could just as easily access each of those programs here on my Web site and do the work yourself. Similarly, you could sign up, in time, for each of those interactive programs available through [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach/halhigdon#trainingplans), my interactive partner. But I’ve done the work for you.

Training for the marathon, or any other running race, is not easy. It’s hard work. It takes discipline. But it’s also a lot of fun, as you’ll soon discover, particularly if you run with a friend or a group of runners. More detailed instructions on how to use this program can be found in the introductions for [Base Training](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/tp-15998/hal-higdon-base-training-novice) and [Marathon Novice 1](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon/tp-15877/hal-higdon-marathon-novice-1).

#### Reviews

#### Just what I was looking for

June 12, 2020

Okay, so I did this program about 3 years ago when I made the decision to run a marathon. Let me put this into perspective: I had run a half marathon almost 4 years prior to that (I did the Novice 1) and that was the extent of my running background. However, I got the itch to run a marathon and really needed something that felt… attainable and doable. THIS was that program. I was never the person that someone would think would run a marathon and as long as you stick with the length of this program, it is everything you will need. If I ever decide to run a marathon again, this is absolutely the program I will use.[Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-supreme/#)

This program is quite literally “this is a marathon, not a sprint” and is in no way intimidating to train for it. I loved it and anyone I know who is ever interested in running a marathon and putting in the time, I will recommend this to them.

Overall, Hal, thank you. Thank you for creating a program like this so people like me can achieve that once unattainable dream.

#### A Great Way To Ease Into Things

January 14, 2020

I used this program in 2015. It is a grind, but works great. I ran my first marathon to celebrate my 40th birthday. I’ll be using the program this year to help celebrate 45!!

#### I did it!

May 23, 2019

I followed the plan above and I just finished my first Marathon.

And my last Marathon.

But I did it! Thank you for sharing this. Glad I found it ~40 weeks ago.

#### Super Novice Success

August 7, 2018

My husband (in his 60’s) and I (in my 50’s) had never completed a race – ever! We followed the Super Novice Marathon plan and had a GREAT experience. I finished 15th out of 47 in my category!! My husband made it his 1st and last – but I went on to finish a second marathon 7 months later and now 3 months later will finish my 3rd marathon in 3 weeks. THANKS for the great training!![Show more](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-supreme/#)
