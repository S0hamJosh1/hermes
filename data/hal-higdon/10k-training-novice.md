### About the Novice Program

This program has been designed for new runners looking for a training program to prepare them for a 10K race. Or for experienced runners, looking for an easy schedule involving a relatively low level of weekly miles. Each day, Hal will send you an email telling you what to run and also offering tips about training.

This plan is not available in the RunWithHal app, but you can still get the interactive version through TrainingPeaks. Or, explore more training options in the app:

#### Hal on his Novice Program

**HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO TRAIN TO RUN 10K?** If you possess a good level of fitness (because of participation in other sports) you probably could run a half dozen miles on very little training. That might include running shorter races, such as a 5K or an 8K.

But if you’ve made the decision to run a 10K race you might as well do it right. Following is an eight-week training schedule to help get you to the finish line of a 10K. (For those metrically challenged, 10K is 6.2 miles.)

The program is designed for beginning runners, but experienced runners like it too, because of its gentle approach. To participate in this 10K program, you should have no major health problems, and perhaps have done at least some jogging or walking. If running 2.5 miles for your first workout on Tuesday of the first week seems too difficult, you might want to pause before taking your first steps. If you have more than eight weeks before your 10K, switch to an easier (shorter) schedule to build an endurance base.

The terms used in the training schedule are somewhat obvious, but let me explain what I mean anyway.

**Rest**: The first word you encounter in the 10K Novice Program, and in many of my other training plans from 5K to the marathon, is “rest.” I suggest you rest on Fridays before your weekend workouts and on Mondays after those workouts. You can’t train efficiently if fatigued. Take rest days seriously.

**Running workouts**: As a novice, don’t worry about how fast you run; just cover the distance–or approximately the distance suggested each day. Ideally, you should be able to run at a pace that allows you to converse comfortably with any training partners. In the 10K Novice plan, you run three days of the week: Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.

**Cross-Training**: On the schedule, this is identified simply as “cross.” Wednesdays and Saturdays are cross-training days: swimming, cycling, walking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or other forms of aerobic training. But don’t cross-train too vigorously. Cross-training days should be easy days.

**Long Runs**: The longest runs are planned for Sundays, since you probably have more time to do them on the weekends. If Sunday isn’t a convenient day for your long runs, feel free to do them on Saturday, cross-training on Sundays. What pace should you run? Go slow. Don’t be afraid to take walking breaks. Just cover the distance.

**Strength Training**: Have you lifted before? If not, you may not want to start the same time you start a running program. Tuesdays and Thursdays are good days for strength training– _after_ your run. Stretching also is important to keep your muscles loose.

**Walking**: Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training. In the training schedule below, I don’t specify walking workouts, but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need a break. (Be aware that I have a separate 10K walking program if you decide to walk rather than run your goal 10K.)

The following schedule is only a guide. If necessary, you can make minor modifications to suit your work and family schedule. The interactive programs available from TrainingPeaks offer much more detailed instructions.

#### Great plan for beginners

March 16, 2025

I used this plan to train for a 10K. I was not running at all before this. In fact I was sick for 3 weeks before this plan start. I did have a base level of fitness going into this though (i have been occasionally hiking, rowing all year). What I like about this plan… it is consistent, has a gradual increase in distance, and is definitely doable for beginners. While training I learned that I can actually run the first 2.5 miles without stopping! It was my first time going that distance but I just went out and did it. Of course I ran slowly like 14 min miles or so. I was worried this plan would overtrain me starting out with so many miles per week but I was ok! I only had exactly 8 weeks til my run so I did not have any room for skipping a week. If I did this again I would schedule a race that is 9 weeks out giving me a week just in case I needed to skip a week. What I did not like about this plan is that there is little guidance on how fast to run. I just tried to run slow at first and every week increase my time a little. A few times I ran/walked the distance. I started out at 13-14 min/mi pace then eventually ended up running around 12:30 min/mi average pace for the week. I finished my 10K race at 1 hr and 8 mins which puts me at 11 min/mi pace for my race. I was incredibly happy with that pace and time! If you are reading this and wondering if you should try it out I’d say go for it. At my race most of my friends either didn’t train consistently or barely ran at all, I felt so good knowing i basically ran every week for 8 weeks up to the run.Show more

#### The Programming Works!

February 17, 2025

I trained for a 10K using the novice program after many years off from distance running. The daily targets push you to be on your feet, so you are both physically and mentally prepared for race day. There were a couple of training runs where I couldn’t measure up, but the program is robust enough to accommodate for those tougher training days. I ended up exceeding all my goals at the 10K race plus unexpectedly placing 3rd in my age group. Very grateful for these programs!Show more

#### Amazing Programs

April 18, 2022

I have self coached my self with 3 of Hal’s programs ranging from 10km through to 3 very successful Marathons, 1 being 3. Hrs 38mins with a 38 min 10 k race in the lead up. I have been out of running for a few years and finally about to start back and will be using the 10km Novice to find running enjoying again. One reason I was so successful is Hal’s programs enable you to succeed to limits you may not know your capable of. Have Fun Running!Show more

Hello! Thank you sooo much for this amazing plan! However, I was wondering, can we do our regular workout plan along with this or should we choose this as our workout plan?
